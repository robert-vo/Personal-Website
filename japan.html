<p>hi im robert and thanks for reading this page about japan. it&#39;s mostly about tokyo/kyoto/osaka since most people don&#39;t venture outside of those 3 cities. if you have questions about any other part of japan, ask away cause i probably went there</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">pre-japan (general travel tips)</h1>

<h2 id="toc_3">what to bring</h2>

<ul>
<li>US passport</li>
<li>(optional) a black ink pen

<ul>
<li>usually at immigration/customs there will be a handful of shared pens for a few hundred people<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(optional) spare US passport photos (2x2 inches)

<ul>
<li>this is just in case your passport gets stolen</li>
<li>if it does get stolen, report to the closest US embassy and they&#39;ll print one on the spot...given you have a passport photo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a second suitcase (or buy a duffle bag in japan) for all of the fancy kit-kats you&#39;re going to buy. most airlines will let you bring 2 checked bags, but please double check with them. US-based airlines (american, united) usually give you 2 checked bags if it&#39;s a trans-pacific flight </li>
<li>smartphone with the following apps: 

<ul>
<li>google maps</li>
<li>foursquare, i guess?</li>
<li>yelp (not really common in japan, it&#39;s mostly foreigners on it)</li>
<li>maps.me for offline maps, as google maps doesn&#39;t support offline maps in most of asia</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">prep work</h2>

<ul>
<li>i highly recommend scanning or taking a picture your passport and saving it to dropbox/google drive/onedrive

<ul>
<li>some accomodation require a passport for check-in and, although very unlikely, you might hit a situation where you&#39;re passport-less but still need to check into your accomodation. it&#39;s happened to me in vietnam!!<br></li>
</ul></li>
<li>set travel notices with your credit card companies so they know you&#39;re in japan

<ul>
<li>a surprising number of places in japan DO accept credit cards. they&#39;re going through a credit card wave at the moment (saw a bunch VISA ❤ JAPAN ads)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>request japanese yen from your bank

<ul>
<li>alternatively, please get the charles schwab total checking account zero ATM fees worldwide &amp; foreign transaction ATM fees reimbursed<br></li>
<li>you could withdraw yen using your chase/bofa/wells/etc. card in japan, but you get fucked with fees ($5 + 3% of the TOTAL withdrawal per withdrawl) 

<ul>
<li>i digress, but we shouldn&#39;t even be using chase/bofa/wells anymore bc there are other banks with zero monthly fee, a checking account interest 20x higher than chase&#39;s highest offering, savings accounts 170x higher than chase, etc. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">landing in japan</h2>

<p>if you&#39;re familiar with immigration/customs with any country, you can skip this section.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">flight to japan</h3>

<p>the gate attendant will ask to see your passport before they&#39;ll let you board the plane. that&#39;s normal.</p>

<p>during your flight, the flight attendents should give you an immigration card to fill out. you should fill this out with the handy black pen you packed with you.  if the flight attendent forgets to give it to you, you can pick some up before immigrations at the airport.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">immigration</h3>

<p>follow signs for FOREIGN PASSPORTS. after waiting in the queue for an indeterminant of time, you&#39;ll hand your passport + immigration card to the passport agent. they might ask you questions, or not, and after it&#39;s done, they&#39;ll place a stamp in your passport. woohoo you&#39;re (almost) in japan</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">checked bags</h3>

<p>after immigration, you&#39;ll go claim your checked bags. pretty standard process</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">customs</h3>

<p>follow signs for &quot;Nothing to Declare&quot;. sometimes they&#39;ll scan your bags through an x-ray machine and the agent will ask you some questions. please don&#39;t bring pounds of gold, livestock, and pornography. i hope they show you images of porn and drugs to ask if you have this in possession because they did that with me lol.</p>

<p>walk through customs and you&#39;re officially in japan! wow so proud much japan</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">options for getting out of the airport</h3>

<ul>
<li>uber (it&#39;s marked up in japan because only luxury ubers can exist!! 250 USD one way from narita airport to tokyo station, 50 USD one way from haneda to tokyo station)</li>
<li>public transportation

<ul>
<li>you&#39;ll see signs for subway lines to tokyo within the airport. it&#39;s hard to miss </li>
</ul></li>
<li>coach buses</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_11">culture</h1>

<h3 id="toc_12">walking</h3>

<p>in tokyo, they walk on the LEFT. you&#39;ll notice this on the escalators where you&#39;re expect to stand on the left, walk on the right. </p>

<h3 id="toc_13">walking and eating</h3>

<p>it&#39;s considered taboo to walk and eat at the same time. don&#39;t ask me, it&#39;s their culture. tsukiji fish market even has a sign saying walking and eating is prohibited.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">handling cash/card</h3>

<p>when you hand cash or a credit card to a cashier, please don&#39;t throw it at them. there is a tray that they&#39;ll pass on to you, which you place the cash on, and you pass the tray back. if the tray doesn&#39;t exist, then you can hand the cash to them. </p>

<h3 id="toc_15">am i really safe in japan?</h3>

<p>honestly i felt safe in most of asia. like i feel safer in vietnam than i do in midtown houston. there&#39;s a running joke in japan where if you drop your wallet on the floor, you&#39;ll find it returned to you with more cash in it, because they felt like you needed the extra cash.</p>

<p>although, stay out of roppongi (where a good chunk of bars/clubs are at) at night because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerians_in_Japan">&quot;Nigerians&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">tippi-</h3>

<p>don&#39;t even try</p>

<h3 id="toc_17">tax?</h3>

<p>some places do charge value added tax (VAT) on top of the menu item. some places include the VAT on the advertised prices. it varies, just like the US, but it tends to favor the latter</p>

<h3 id="toc_18">slurping noodles??</h3>

<p>we think slurping the noodles tells the chef that we really like the dish. it makes sense, right?! no it&#39;s a myth sorry y&#39;all just eat your noodles the way you want to</p>

<h3 id="toc_19">sushi with your hands??????</h3>

<p>the correct way of eating sushi is with your hands. japanese sushi is different from western sushi though. they don&#39;t have fancy rolls like california roll, spider rolls, etc., their sushi is just fish + rice. the chopsticks may break up the rice</p>

<p>and they add (real!!) wasabi to all of your sushi. if you don&#39;t want wasabi, tell them prior. real wasabi doesn&#39;t burn your mouth as much. in the west, &quot;wasabi&quot; is horseradish, which is why it burns</p>

<h3 id="toc_20">train etiquette</h3>

<p>don&#39;t make yourself known to other passengers (eating, talking like a &quot;westerner&quot;)</p>

<h3 id="toc_21">drinking in public</h3>

<p>you can do it. just don&#39;t walk and drink. </p>

<h3 id="toc_22">clubs, identification, and you</h3>

<p>i was never IDed in Japan. but doesn&#39;t hurt to keep your passport on you.</p>

<h3 id="toc_23">sake bombs</h3>

<p>sake bombs thought to be made by the americans in japan after ww2. it&#39;s not a thing they do in japan and you&#39;ll get a bunch of stares. (good) sake is meant to be enjoyed and not chugged. imagine if you saw a bunch of japanese tourists doing whisky bombs at buffalo wild wings or if you went to france to do wine bombs at hard rock cafe </p>

<h3 id="toc_24">cheering</h3>

<p>kanpai (fun fact: it&#39;s the same in chinese!) </p>

<h3 id="toc_25">queueing</h3>

<p>japanese people take their queues seriously. don&#39;t cut or attempt to take a shortcut (like taking the short path around a corner to cut them off to an escalator entrance)</p>

<h3 id="toc_26">bowing</h3>

<p>everyone bows. you should too</p>

<h3 id="toc_27">take-out food?</h3>

<p>generally, they say takeaway not &quot;take-out&quot;. its rare for places to offer you a to-go container for your ramen, or just food in general. their idea is that the food presented to your table is ready to be consumed right at that moment.</p>

<h3 id="toc_28">TRASH</h3>

<p>you&#39;ll notice very little trash on the floor and very few trash cans in the wild. but what do you do with all of your trash? solution: you give it to the restaurants, who will properly dispose of it, or you wait to see a trash can in the wild. convenience stores will have trash bins too</p>

<p>p.s. you&#39;ll be grateful on how little trash the US gives out compared to asian countries. cashiers would try to individually bag items in their own plastic bag and im like, please stop. why do i need a plastic bag for my milk tea. why does using a credit card print out up to FIVE receipts??</p>

<h3 id="toc_29">bidets</h3>

<p>use them. also learn how to use the seat warmers and you&#39;ll buy one for your house afterwards</p>

<h3 id="toc_30">appearance</h3>

<p>tattoos are considered taboo at onsens and stuff. you&#39;ll be fine flaunting them in public. </p>

<h3 id="toc_31">smoking/vaping</h3>

<p>smoking culture is everywhere in japan, and asia. you&#39;re fine with vaping, just don&#39;t walk and vape. you&#39;re fine going in the designated smoking areas, bars, or some restaurants, and vaping there.</p>

<p>yes, you can smoke in restaurants, bars, pachinko rooms, train stations, etc. just ask first or find the smoking friendly booth. you&#39;ll notice if it&#39;s smoker friendly when the walls and menu is yellow...lol its disgusting</p>

<h3 id="toc_32">outlets</h3>

<p>japan uses the same format as north american outlets, but the voltage is different. you should be fine with your phone chargers, but don&#39;t bring your hair dryer!! you&#39;ll kill the hair dryer. i saw it happen in person hahaha</p>

<h3 id="toc_33">etc.</h3>

<p>pretty much don&#39;t draw attention to yourself (talk loud on the subways, eat and walk) and follow the rules</p>

<h1 id="toc_34">public transportation</h1>

<h2 id="toc_35">preface</h2>

<p>japan&#39;s rail is privatized. lots of people get confused while transferring lines because you might have to exit the train station and enter through a separate entrance to transfer to a different rail company. for example, there are 2 rail companies operating within tokyo&#39;s metro (toei, Japan Rail/JR). it&#39;s common for cities to have their own rail company (Toei is for tokyo&#39;s metro) that&#39;s supplemented with the JR lines (mostly intercity travel with some intracity travel). if you use google maps, you&#39;ll never be confused!!! unless you can&#39;t read numbers, images and signs then i cant help you there</p>

<h2 id="toc_36">what is suica</h2>

<p>suica is your best friend while in japan. this is a NFC card (also used as payment!!) that lets you do the following:  </p>

<ul>
<li>pay for MOST public transportation (doesn&#39;t cover the super rural parts of japan)</li>
<li>pay for things at 7/11, familymart</li>
<li>pay for your bills at some restaurants</li>
<li>purchase items from the plethora of vending machines around japan </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_37">how to get suica</h3>

<p>please get the suica card!! i saw so many tourists pay for the subway fares for every single ride and that takes up everyone&#39;s time (imagine pulling out cash every time you exit the subway station lol) plus you have to wait for those tourists if you have the JR pass! how annoying</p>

<p>at narita/haneda, if you follow signs for tokyo (or ask anyone there, they all speak english), you&#39;ll reach a point where you&#39;ll need to go through turnstiles to enter the subway. there should be ticketing machines near it and you can purchase a suica card there. each card requires a 500 yen (approx. 4.55 USD) deposit. i would personally reload 5,000 yen (approx. 45.46 USD) on the card. it probably won&#39;t be enough for a week, but you can reload it at any 7/11s, familymarts, and train stations.</p>

<h3 id="toc_38">using the suica card</h3>

<p>when you enter the train stations and buses, you tap on the card reader at the entrance and you tap out to exit. </p>

<p>note: for some cities, you DON&#39;T tap when you exit, since it&#39;s flat rate (i encountered it in some cities in the hokkaido prefecture)</p>

<h4 id="toc_39">what if i don&#39;t have enough money on my card on exit?</h4>

<p>you might run into this scenario if you have, for example, 500 yen left on your card, but you go to a far zone and they want to charge you 550 yen.</p>

<p>there&#39;s a fare adjustment machine right before the exit at each station. when you tap your card, it&#39;ll tell you how much money you need to add (cash only) to your card in order to exit. </p>

<h4 id="toc_40">what if i don&#39;t tap in/out?</h4>

<p>your card will fail to work next time you enter/exit. you have to take the suica card to the ticket office, explain what happened, &quot;im a confused tourist sorry&quot;, and they&#39;ll reactivate your card.</p>

<h3 id="toc_41">google maps</h3>

<p>honestly google maps is magical in japan. it&#39;s all you&#39;ll really need. google maps tells you EVERYTHING (where the elevators are in the train stations, train station layouts, which train car to get on, which entrance/exit to take, price of the subway(s), public rail company)</p>

<p>well, when it works, it&#39;s magical. it doesn&#39;t work this well in the countryside.</p>

<h2 id="toc_42">JR Pass &amp; bullets trains</h2>

<h3 id="toc_43">should i get the JR pass?</h3>

<p>yes. unless you are on a backpackers budget, the JR pass enables unlimited access to the shinkansen (bullet trains) and JR intracity trains. </p>

<p>however, don&#39;t &quot;activate&quot; the JR pass if you&#39;re starting off in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto for a few days. JR fares within the city are only, like, 200 yen a pop. you should activate the JR pass when you first take the shinkansen, since a one-way on the shinkansen starts off at 3,000 yen to 15,000 yen (yes about 120 dollars for a one way).</p>

<h3 id="toc_44">what if i am a broke backpacker cooking my own meals in hostels</h3>

<p>chose the wrong country, bud. southeast asia is a 6 hour flight away. but if you insist on NOT getting the JR pass and want to travel to other cities, you could either:   </p>

<ul>
<li>fly. it&#39;s cheaper to fly than to take the bullet train lol, but you have to pay for trains to/from city centers to airports...so it ends up almost costing the same price. plus you get no flexibility with changing flights unlike the shinkansen</li>
<li>sleeper buses

<ul>
<li>do you really hate yourself to do this. it&#39;s 9+ hours from tokyo to osaka (70 dollars) while a shinkansen (110 dollars) is 1.5 hours with outlets &amp; wifi </li>
</ul></li>
<li>hitchhike. but do you think the japanese has a hitchhiking culture? only one way to find out</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_45">how much is the JR pass if i buy it in advance?</h3>

<ul>
<li>¥29,110 (269 USD) for 7 days</li>
<li>¥46,390 (428 USD) for 14 days</li>
<li>¥59,350 (549 USD) for 21 days</li>
</ul>

<p>this is for UNLIMITED shinkansen trains. i ended up getting the 14 days pass and used ¥130,000 (around 1,200 USD) in bullet trains in total. i paid about 50,000 yen because i didn&#39;t buy it in advance.</p>

<p>you can buy the JR pass in advance via JR&#39;s website and pick it up in Japan, or have it mailed to you in the US.</p>

<h3 id="toc_46">buying JR pass at the station</h3>

<p>you go to the JR ticket OFFICE for the shinkansen and tell them you want to purchase the JR pass. the ticket COUNTER will ask you to show your JR pass and, if you don&#39;t have one, they&#39;ll point you to the ticket OFFICE. expect to pay an additional 10% for not purchasing it in advance.</p>

<h3 id="toc_47">how to use the JR pass for shinkansens</h3>

<p>scenario: you just woke up in your king bed in the ritz-carlton, tokyo, and you need to make your way to osaka to get your michelin star omakase. you pull up the directions via google maps and see that you have to take the shinkansen to osaka. you make your way to tokyo station with the JR pass in hand (it&#39;s a paper card).</p>

<p>you enter the train station via the gate agent and flash your JR pass. they let you into the train station and you bow, saying arigatou gozaimasu in the most foreigner way. once in tokyo station, you see a bunch of signs for shinkansen. it&#39;s everywhere, on the ceiling, on the floor, but you happened to miss all of the signs because you were busy munching on your 2nd onigiri for the day. don&#39;t worry, everyone speaks english and tells you where the JR ticketing office is. but woops, you ended up at the JR East office. please don&#39;t go to the JR East office, you&#39;re not going to Sendai/Hakodate/Sapporo. go to the JR west office. </p>

<p>at the JR West (whatever, it&#39;s not east) ticket office, you queue up and tell the agent &quot;Osaka, as soon as possible&quot;. they print out the ticket and you read the train departure times to see which platform you have to get on. or, you know, google maps already told you which platform the train leaves from. </p>

<p>from the ticket office, you have to present your JR pass (not the ticket for the train!!) to another agent to enter the shinkansen portion of the station. find the station platform, board the train, and you&#39;re on your way to Osaka! once in Osaka, you flash the JR pass to the gate agent at the exit of the train station, shouting arigatou gozaimasu while doing a weird 45 degree bow </p>

<h4 id="toc_48">tldr</h4>

<ul>
<li>go to train station</li>
<li>enter train station by showing the JR pass to the agent, located next to the turnstiles

<ul>
<li>you&#39;re now in the train station, but not the shinkansen part of the station</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;purchase&quot; a ticket at the ticket office with your JR pass to wherever you&#39;re going

<ul>
<li>tip: you can purchase advance tickets for other trips too!! it&#39;s useful if you know you&#39;re going back the same day and don&#39;t want to wait in the queue </li>
</ul></li>
<li>enter the shinkansen part of the train station by showing the JR pass to the agent</li>
<li>find the platform via the departure’s signs, enter the train and sit down in your assigned seats

<ul>
<li>non-reserved seats are usually at the front 3/6/9 trains </li>
</ul></li>
<li>on exit, show the JR pass (not your ticket!!) to the gate agent</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_49">JR tips and questions</h3>

<h4 id="toc_50">do i get wifi and outlets on the train?</h4>

<p>yes to both!!</p>

<h4 id="toc_51">what can&#39;t i use the JR pass on</h4>

<p>Toei subways (use your suica card), Nozomi and Mizuho bullet trains, and other rails/ferries/subways that don&#39;t operate with JR. Again, use your suica card.</p>

<h4 id="toc_52">what are the Nozomi and Mizuho trains</h4>

<p>super express trains along the fukoka-hiroshima-osaka-tokyo path</p>

<h4 id="toc_53">what about my 2 suitcases full of 20kg of plushies</h4>

<p>there are overhead trays where you can put even the largest of suitcases on</p>

<h4 id="toc_54">what&#39;s the purpose of the ticket if you never show it to anyone</h4>

<p>its so no one sits in your reserved seat and you&#39;re guaranteed to sit next to your friends. you don&#39;t have to get a ticket if you don&#39;t feel like waiting in line</p>

<h4 id="toc_55">what if the shinkansen is full??</h4>

<p>the agent will say it&#39;s full, but that&#39;s with respect to assigned seating. there&#39;s always standing room in the shinkansen. imagine standing shoulder to shoulder for 2 hours...that was my life when the typhoon hit tokyo and everyone was scrambling to leave the city</p>

<h4 id="toc_56">what happens if i get book a reserved seat and don&#39;t go on the train?</h4>

<p>nothing. don&#39;t stress over missing the train. enjoy that onigiri</p>

<h4 id="toc_57">missed the train?</h4>

<p>just hop on the next non-Nozomi or non-Mizuho train in the non-reserved area (front of the train).</p>

<p>for tokyo-osaka, there is a train that leaves every SIX minutes. so if it&#39;s really full, go on the next non-nozomi or non-mizuho train.</p>

<h4 id="toc_58">what happens if i get on the nozomi/mizuho shinkansen train</h4>

<p>you get ticketed and you&#39;re forced to pay full fare for the trip. yup. there goes the money (about 125 USD) you could&#39;ve used on that omakase. the platform will tell you if it&#39;s nozomi/mizuho and the announcements will say, in perfect english, JR pass is NOT eligible for this train.</p>

<p>and, yes, they DO check. they check once the train has departed and there are no stops for 1.5 hours...lol good luck hiding. </p>

<p>story time: i got on the mizuho line and but didn&#39;t get ticketed because i didn&#39;t look like a confused backpacker. yay</p>

<h4 id="toc_59">does the shinkansen really leave on time?</h4>

<p>yes why are you even asking. watch the clock on top of the train stations. once it hits the time for the train to depart, the doors immediately close and the train leaves. </p>

<h4 id="toc_60">how much time do i have to get off the train?</h4>

<p>if you are leaving at the terminus, you have a few minutes to get off. if you are leaving at a stop along the way, you have about 30 seconds to get everything and leave before the train doors close. the announcements will tell you to get ready to leave before the train stops. you should stand by the doors before the train stops, seriously.</p>

<h4 id="toc_61">others</h4>

<p>fun fact: texas is in the works for building the first shinkansen in north america!! houston - dallas in 90 minutes with stops</p>

<h2 id="toc_62">Toei Metro (Tokyo)</h2>

<h3 id="toc_63">unlimited Toei passes?!</h3>

<h4 id="toc_64">cost</h4>

<ul>
<li>24 hours: Adult: 800 yen Child: 400 yen</li>
<li>48 hours: Adult: 1,200 yen Child: 600 yen</li>
<li>72 hours: Adult: 1,500 yen Child: 750 yen</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_65">where to buy</h4>

<ul>
<li>bicqlo (uniqlo + bic camera store) </li>
<li>airports</li>
<li>hotels</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_66">how to buy it</h4>

<p>you play the confused tourist card and say you want Toei unlimited pass. you have to present your passport to purchase the pass. the pass is activate the first time you use it.</p>

<h4 id="toc_67">is it worth it?</h4>

<p>if you stay within tokyo for a few days, yes it&#39;s worth it. if you do a mix of tokyo + nearby cities, it&#39;s NOT worth it, because you&#39;re using a mix of Toei and JR.</p>

<h3 id="toc_68">how to get on</h3>

<ul>
<li>you use your suica card to tap into the station, and please tap out when you exit. that&#39;s it.</li>
<li>if you have the Toei pass, you insert the card (it feels like a business card) into the turnstile. you insert the same card on exist.

<ul>
<li>if it&#39;s your first time using the Toei card, the machine will hole punch it. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_69">other private rail companies?</h2>

<p>if you are going outside of osaka/kyoto/tokyo, just message me. most tourists don&#39;t visit outside of these three big cities, but i went to the countryside and saw a myriad of different companies and they have their subtle differences (one city had a physical stamp card...lol)</p>

<h1 id="toc_70">accomodation suggestions</h1>

<p>note: i have zero experience with hotels in japan<br>
hostels -&gt; hostelworld or booking.com<br>
expect to pay at least $20/night for a bunk. japan&#39;s hostels cost just as much as american hostels.</p>

<h2 id="toc_71">tokyo</h2>

<p>ideally stay around shinjuku or harujuku. that&#39;s where most of the action is and it&#39;s very easy to get anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="toc_72">kyoto</h2>

<p>stay around the gion corner area, closer towards the city center.</p>

<h2 id="toc_73">osaka</h2>

<p>around dotonbori is fine. i stayed at shinsaibashi (10 minutes walking north) and it wasn&#39;t bad.</p>

<h2 id="toc_79">where on earth should i withdraw cash</h2>

<p>good on you for getting the charles schwab card and not getting charged, like, 12 bucks, to withdraw 100 dollars. there are ATMs in 7/11s, familymarts, train stations, etc. </p>

<h2 id="toc_80">is japan mostly cash only?</h2>

<p>not really, i used my card for about half of the transactions. you could flash your credit card and say VISA and they&#39;ll nod or make their hands into an X to indicate if they take it or not. some places will incentivize you to use cash by offering a discount with cash purchases.</p>

<h3 id="toc_81">places that took card</h3>

<ul>
<li>sushi restaurants</li>
<li>fancy dining places </li>
<li>accomodation</li>
<li>airports</li>
<li>7/11s, familymarts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_82">places that didn&#39;t take card</h3>

<ul>
<li>restaurants with the vending machines ordering (includes 100% of ramen shops)</li>
<li>vending machines</li>
<li>pachinko slots</li>
<li>arcades</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_83">foreign transaction fees</h2>

<p>you withdrew physical cash without any ATM fees and foreign transaction fees thanks to your nifty free charles schwab checking account, but what if i wanted to use my credit card for purchases?</p>

<p>make sure your credit card has no foreign transaction fee, or else be prepared to pay 3%+ on top of E V E R Y T H I N G</p>

<p>highly recommend getting a card with no foreign transaction fee anyways. you know how much banks make off of these fees? very little. they only charge you this fee to nickel and dime you. source: i worked at one</p>

<h3 id="toc_84">when paying with your credit card</h3>

<p>it&#39;s the same anywhere you go, with the EXCEPTION OF: </p>

<ul>
<li>when the prompt on the machine asks you if you want to pay with Japanese Yen or United States Dollars.

<ul>
<li>Choose Japanese Yen if your card has NO foreign transaction fees</li>
<li>Choose United State Dollars if your card HAS foreign transaction fees

<ul>
<li>if your card has no foreign transaction fees and you selected USD, you basically paid an extra 3% for the &quot;convenience&quot; of using USD. seriously, look it up. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>sometimes the cashier will try to be &quot;polite&quot; and select it for you. please make sure you look at the credit card terminal so you don&#39;t spend more money than you have to. also be prepared to sign a bunch of receipts, i&#39;ve gotten as many as 5 receipts for using one credit card (bank receipt, visa receipt, restaurant receipt, confirmation receipt...etc.)</p>

<h1 id="toc_85">overrated things or things i wish i didn&#39;t do in tokyo/osaka/kyoto</h1>

<h2 id="toc_86">tsukiji fish market</h2>

<p>the famous tsukiji fish market moved south and its now known as the toyosu fish market. the current tsukiji market felt dead the entire time i was there. toyosu is a bit more lively, but it isn&#39;t the same vibe anymore (toyosu is mostly indoors, tsukiji is mostly outdoors).</p>

<p>foreigners are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to see the tuna auctions up and personal anymore. watch a video on youtube, that&#39;s all you need to see.</p>

<p>the famous sushi dai and daiwa sushi moved to toyosu!! last time i went to japan sushi dai was showing up in tsukiji fish market.</p>

<h2 id="toc_87">arashiyama monkey park</h2>

<p>it&#39;s just another monkey park full of monkeys that steal your food lol. i guess you could do it if you aren&#39;t going anywhere else in asia. </p>

<p><strong>tip</strong> put in google maps: &quot;Arashiyama Monkey Park&quot; and not just &quot;Arashiyama&quot;. Arashiyama on google maps takes you to a ditch with a sign saying you are at the wrong location</p>

<h2 id="toc_88">teamLab Borderless</h2>

<p>probably going to get flamed for saying its overrated lol, but the overrated stuff is the stuff where you wait insane amounts of time for</p>

<ol>
<li>admission is about 30 USD</li>
<li>queues queues queues queues QUEUES

<ul>
<li>we waited an hour to get inside</li>
<li>some of the light attractions have multiple hour waits </li>
<li>like, we waited 90 minutes for a room with a 2 minute light show where you lay on a net</li>
<li>another one we waited an hour for a room full of balls that your group of 20 people gets 30 seconds to explore. yes, 30 seconds and they do time you </li>
</ul></li>
<li>you&#39;re better off just walking around the place and not waiting in line, but you won&#39;t get the &quot;full&quot; experience. whatever</li>
<li>it&#39;s going to be extremely hard to take photos inside without a decent camera. if you use flash, the lights won&#39;t show up in the picture</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="toc_89">nara deer park</h2>

<p>the only thing to do in nara is see the japanese deer. but you can see the japanese deer in other parts of japan, not just nara!! only recommended if you have 3+ hours to spare from kyoto/osaka</p>

<h2 id="toc_90">dotonbori</h2>

<p>it&#39;s like the nyc of japan. trash everywhere, people in spiderman costumes trying to scam you out of money, no one walks on the proper side of the sidewalk, people offering prostitutes, you got them all. but, hey, it&#39;s a cool shopping district with a river flowing through it</p>

<h2 id="toc_91">tokyo skytree</h2>

<p>i, personally, didn&#39;t go here. but if it&#39;s what i&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s just another overlook with insane queues. also, tokyo has many <strong>free</strong> overlooks (with no waits), why are you paying 30+ dollars for this one. </p>

<h2 id="toc_92">golden gai alley in shinjuku</h2>

<p>it&#39;s the place with the super cramped (5 seats at most) bars. it&#39;s catered towards foreigners and you don&#39;t see a lot of salarymen here. most places will charge you cover to get in fyi. better off going to a normal bar, but it&#39;s cool to say you&#39;ve been in a bar smaller than your bedroom</p>

<h2 id="toc_93">akihabara</h2>

<p>so akihabara is okay for a little bit. if you&#39;re a weeb, you can visit the plethora of anime, hentai and electronics shops. but they are everywhere else in japan. akihabara is cool if you want to find japanese exclusive games (i got one for my brother), if you want to find your waifu at the maid cafes, or like looking at electronics you&#39;re going to end up buying on amazon</p>

<h2 id="toc_94">shiba cafes (or just any animal cafes)</h2>

<p>dunno if i would support the animal cafes because of their animal treatment. the shibas get constant attention and they don&#39;t want that, plus shibas at shiba cafes are specifically bred to be smaller than normal (mameshiba cafe -&gt; mame means bean in japanese, and bean is what japanese use to describe something cute).</p>

<h2 id="toc_95">pachinko</h2>

<p>it&#39;s full of smoke and depressed salarymen. bet 500 yen, lose it all, and you got the full experience</p>

<h1 id="toc_96">shopping</h1>

<h2 id="toc_97">tax exemption</h2>

<p>you can get tax exemption on purchases totaling 5,000 yen to 500,000 (about 48 USD to 4,800 USD).</p>

<p>see: https://tax-freeshop.jnto.go.jp/eng/shopping-guide.php</p>

<p>at some stores, like don quijote, there is a counter that you show them your receipt to get the tax refund. you have to show them your passport to get the refund! they also staple the receipt to your passport and, when you leave the country, the immigration officer removes the receipts.</p>

<p>the tax free counter also exists at department stores</p>

<h2 id="toc_103">hakone</h2>

<p>ok, i haven&#39;t mentioned hakone yet, but it&#39;s a small little town about 30 minutes away from tokyo via the shinkansen. it&#39;s a fun day trip and the place has amazing views of mt fuji. i recommend going if it&#39;s a clear day. also be prepared to get your suica card destroyed because a single bus ride is 900 yen (8 USD)</p>

<h1 id="toc_106">fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood</h1>

<h2 id="toc_107">im hungry and idk what to eat</h2>

<ul>
<li>tabelog is japan&#39;s yelp. link - <a href="https://tabelog.com/en">https://tabelog.com/en</a>

<ul>
<li>there is no mobile app on the US app store, use the website </li>
</ul></li>
<li>use yelp/foursquare/google reviews if you want foreigners opinions</li>
<li>last resort: 24/7 diners that serve cheap bomb ass curry and beef bowls</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_108">how on earth does tabelog work</h3>

<p>japanese people rate things differently. here is their rating system: </p>

<ul>
<li>1 star don&#39;t go</li>
<li>2 stars it&#39;s decent</li>
<li>3 stars you should go</li>
<li>3.5 stars you should REALLY go (5/5 yelp)</li>
<li>4 stars michelin quality</li>
<li>4.5 stars LEGENDARY</li>
<li>5 stars doesn&#39;t exist</li>
</ul>

<p>they also prefer saltier foods, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>tabelog tells you the approximate cost of the restaurant, whether they take card or not, location, and more. </p>

<h2 id="toc_109">ramen</h2>

<p>if you&#39;ve ever been to vietnam, you would know that pho is considered breakfast there. like pho places open up really early and some are 24/7 (shoutouts to pho quynh in d1 saigon). it&#39;s the same thing in japan with respect to ramen</p>

<h3 id="toc_110">how to order</h3>

<p>most ramen shops have no servers. you purchase the bowl of ramen at the entrance via a vending machine. you insert cash and press the selection(s) you want and hand it to the chef. a few minutes later, the chef brings out the ramen. easy!</p>

<p>tip: the very first item on the vending machine is their recommended/specialty dish.</p>

<h3 id="toc_111">eating</h3>

<p>slurp, don&#39;t slurp, whatever, you do you</p>

<h3 id="toc_112">finishing up</h3>

<p>clean up after yourself, use the wet towel to wipe down the area and hand the dish back to the chef. or you could walk out, you filthy foreigner. again, please don&#39;t tip.</p>

<h2 id="toc_113">conveyor belt sushi</h2>

<h3 id="toc_114">how to order</h3>

<p>there&#39;s usually a tablet where you can order (specialty stuff or stuff not on the conveyor belt) from. if it&#39;s older style, there will be a paper sheet you write your orders and hand it to the chef. yes, they most likely understand english.</p>

<h3 id="toc_115">paying</h3>

<p>the server comes up and tallies the amount of plates you have with super cool tech (they wave a wand at the plates lol) and prints out a receipt. you hand the receipt to the cashier at the entrance and pay with discover, visa, whatever</p>

<h3 id="toc_116">ordering tips</h3>

<p>there is no minimum order!! sometimes i&#39;d get a regular dinner somewhere and eat two plates of conveyor belt sushi just cause i can lol. enjoy the matcha tea that comes with most conveyor belt places</p>

<p>japan is big on tuna. salmon isn&#39;t as big in japan because it was poverty food until a few decades ago thanks to norway</p>

<h2 id="toc_117">o m a k a s e</h2>

<p>please get an omakase at some point. it&#39;s cheaper than the US and it&#39;s arguably much better. you might have to RSVP for the more popular ones. omakases range from 30 dollars to 500+ dollars. in the US, they would start at 50 dollars for an okay one.</p>

<h3 id="toc_118">sushi hotspot</h3>

<p>ginza is the sushi district in tokyo</p>

<h3 id="toc_119">tips</h3>

<p>you will most likely be seated at the sushi bar. the chef will place the piece of sushi in front of you. you eat said sushi piece. yum.</p>

<ol>
<li>eat ginger </li>
<li>take sushi piece (with wasabi) and put it in your mouth

<ul>
<li>make sure you use your hands!! </li>
</ul></li>
<li>salivate the flavor. mhhm. repeat.</li>

<li>sorry, i don&#39;t have places to suggest, i went to ginza sushiko, and although it was pretty good, the price tag was a bit high for the worth (60 dollars). the chef gave me a tour of the restaurant and showed me the where prime minister abe works though so that was cool</li>

<p>you should be an expert on navigating the super complex subway stations with google maps now, i hope. </p>

<p>if you have your JR pass, it most likely covers the fares to the airport! hooray</p>

<h3 id="toc_128">train station at the airport</h3>

<p>make sure to refund your suica card for yen! the machine will give you 500 yen plus the balance remaining on your card. how nice. in new york, there is no refund :( </p>

<h3 id="toc_129">at the airport</h3>

<p>check into your flight! for some flights abroad, it won&#39;t let you check in via the app. don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not southwest, so you don&#39;t have assigned seating. just make sure you get there on time.</p>

<h3 id="toc_130">immigration</h3>

<p>you give them your passport and they stamp it. that&#39;s all. hooray for being a US citizen</p>

<h3 id="toc_131">customs</h3>

<p>they&#39;ll check if you have any tax exempt receipts and make you sign something if you do have them. they&#39;ll remove the receipts, hooray.</p>
